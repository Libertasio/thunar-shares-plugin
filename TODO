TODO for thunar-shares-plugin
=======================================================================

  * Add emblems to shared folders (Thunar doesn't allow to add/remove
    emblembs from plugins yet).

  * Maybe some help button at shares-admin dialog.

  * We need to review the permissions hierarchy check:
    (libshares/libshares-util.c: tsp_check_perms)

MILESONE 0.20
=======================================================================

  * If we open two or more properties dialogs of the same folder and
    we change the share options there, those changes aren't reflected
    in the other dialogs. Also when changing details from shares-admin
    dialog.

  * Add error checks when we call shares_get_share_info_for_path().

  * 12 chars share-name check should warn the user, isn't a error.
