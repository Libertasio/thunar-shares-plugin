TODO for thunar-shares-plugin
=======================================================================

  * No verbose logging by default (from: libshares/shares.c)!

  * Add emblems to shared folders (Thunar doesn't allow to add/remove
    emblembs from plugins yet).

  * Maybe some help button at shares-admin dialog.

  * We need to review the permissions hierarchy check:
    (libshares/libshares-util.c: tsp_check_perms)
